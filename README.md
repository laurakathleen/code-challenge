#GA Galaxy Navbar Code Challenge

##Bootstrap:
I choose to use Bootstrap because I knew they had some really nice features that would help keep elements within their grid system, with nice drop-downs, and would make styling the rest of the page look just like the mockups I was given (had time permitted, I would have included more of the mockups).

##Challenges:
My biggest challenge was getting the navbar dropdown tag to fall right below the heading that it came from.  If I had more time, I would look back through the Bootstrap documentation to find a solution to this issue.

##jQuery vs. JavaScript:
I choose to use jQuery for the hide/show sign in and sign out buttons, because I knew Boostrap needed jQuery installed anyways, so I decided to stick with just jQuery. 

##Differences in Mockup and My Version
I did notice there was a difference in font type between the mockup and the instructions, so I decided to go with the instructions.
